# Adam's Mandelbrot Set

Mandelbrot Set
--------------
The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers for which the function f(z) = Z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z=0
for which the sequence f(0), f(f(0)) remains bounded in absolute value.

This program outputs the mandelbrot set in only red and is the simplest way this program can function.

Julia Set
--------------
The Julia set is almost the same as the Mandelbrot set. The only difference is that the complex portion and the real portion of the function is switched.
