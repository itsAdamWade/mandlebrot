# Adam's Mandelbrot Set

Mandelbrot Set
--------------
The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers for which the function f(z) = Z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z=0
for which the sequence f(0), f(f(0)) remains bounded in absolute value.

This program outputs the mandelbrot set in only red and is the simplest way this program can function. Press Escape to exit the program.
